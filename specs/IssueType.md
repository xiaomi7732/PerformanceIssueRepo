# Issue Type

We are dealing with various issue categories. The code here in [issue-code.json](./issue-code.json) covers common ones. It is in form of `Code:Name`. For example, `C:OnCPU`.

The code will be used as key and can't be duplicated. The `Name` will be used as semantics to title, descriptions or rationals of the issues.
